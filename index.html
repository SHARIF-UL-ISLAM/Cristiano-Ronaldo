            <h1>CRISTIANO RONALDO</h1>
            <h2>Portuguese football player</h2>
            <h5>Alternate titles: <span class="color-all">Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro</span></h5>
            <p>Cristiano Ronaldo, in full Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro, (born February 5, 1985, <a
                    href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Funchal">Funchal</a>, <a
                    href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Madeira-wine">Madeira,</a>

                <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Portugal">Portugal),</a> Portuguese football (soccer) forward
                who was one of the greatest players of his generation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ronaldo’s father, José Dinis Aveiro, was the equipment manager for the local club Andorinha. (The name
                Ronaldo was added to Cristiano’s name in honour of his father’s favourite movie actor, Ronald Reagan,
                who
                was U.S. president at the time of Cristiano’s birth.) At age 15 Ronaldo was diagnosed with a heart
                condition
                that necessitated surgery, but he was sidelined only briefly and made a full recovery. He first played
                for
                Clube Desportivo Nacional of Madeira and then transferred to Sporting Clube de Portugal (known as
                Sporting
                Lisbon), where he played for that club’s various youth teams before making his debut on Sporting’s first
                team in 2002.A tall player at 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 metres), Ronaldo was a formidable athlete on the
                pitch.
                Originally a right-winger, he developed into a forward with a free-reined attacking style. He was able
                to
                mesmerize opponents with a sleight of foot that made sufficient space for openings in opposing
                defenses.After a successful season with Sporting that brought the young player to the attention of
                Europe’s
                biggest football clubs, Ronaldo signed with English powerhouse Manchester United in 2003. He was an
                instant
                sensation and soon came to be regarded as one of the best forwards in the game. His finest season with
                United came in 2007–08, when he scored 42 League and Cup goals and earned the Golden Shoe award as
                Europe’s
                leading scorer, with 31 League goals. After helping United to a Champions League title in May 2008,
                Ronaldo
                captured Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Player of the Year honours for
                his
                stellar 2007–08 season. He also led United to an appearance in the 2009 Champions League final, which
                they
                lost to <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/FC-Barcelona">FC Barcelona.</a>
                Soon thereafter Ronaldo was sold to Spain’s Real Madrid—a club with which he had long been rumoured to
                want to play—for a then record £80 million (about $131 million) transfer fee. His scoring prowess
                continued with his new team, and he netted the most goals (40) in La Liga history during the 2010–11
                season (his record was broken the following season by his rival Lionel Messi of Barcelona). In 2011–12
                Ronaldo helped Madrid capture a La Liga championship and scored a personal-best 46 goals during the
                League season. He scored a total of 66 goals in 56 appearances with Madrid and the Portuguese national
                team in 2013 to earn his second world player of the year award (the FIFA World Player of the Year was
                renamed the FIFA Ballon d’Or in 2010). In 2014 he scored 52 goals in 43 games and led Madrid to a
                Champions League title, which resulted in Ronaldo capturing another Ballon d’Or award. In 2014–15 he
                netted 48 goals to lead La Liga in scoring. Ronaldo netted his 324th goal as a member of Real in October
                2015 to become the club’s all-time leading goal scorer. He scored 35 La Liga goals in 2015–16 and helped
                Real win its record 11th Champions League title, and in December 2016 he won a fourth career Ballon d’Or
                for his accomplishments. Ronaldo scored 42 goals for Real across all competitions in 2016–17 and led his
                team to La Liga and Champions League titles that season, which resulted in a fifth career Ballon d’Or
                award. In 2017–18 he scored 44 goals in 44 games, and Real won a third straight Champions League title.
                In July 2018 he reached a four-year contract worth €112 million (about $132 million) with the Italian
                powerhouse Juventus. He finished his Real career with 311 goals in 292 matches. He scored 28 goals in
                his first season with Juventus—his lowest domestic goal total since his last season with Manchester
                United—as the powerhouse club won its eighth straight Italian league title.

                On his home soil, after moving through the youth and under-21 ranks, Ronaldo had made his first
                appearance for Portugal’s full national team against Kazakhstan in August 2003 (four days after his
                debut for United). He was a key player in Portugal’s fourth-place finish at the 2006 World Cup and
                became the full-time captain of the national team in 2008. In 2012 his stellar play led Portugal to the
                semifinals of the European Championship, where his team was eliminated by rival Spain in a match that
                was decided by a penalty kick shoot-out. Ronaldo came into the 2014 World Cup hot off of his second
                world player of the year win, but his play at the tournament was spotty, and the entire Portugal team
                struggled during a group-stage elimination. In 2016 he helped Portugal win the European Championship,
                the country’s first major international tournament title, although he only played sparingly in the final
                because of a knee injury that he had sustained early in the match. Ronaldo played brilliantly at the
                2018 World Cup, scoring four goals in four games as Portugal advanced to the knockout round only to lose
                its first match of that stage to a strong defensive Uruguay side.

            <p>Ronaldo was one of the most well-known sports stars off the field, and numerous studies of athletes’
                popularity showed that he was the most-beloved athlete in the world during his playing peak. His extreme
                popularity made Ronaldo one of the highest-paid endorsers in sports history, and in November 2016 he
                became the third person (after basketball superstars Michael Jordan and LeBron James) to earn a
                “lifetime” contract from the sportswear company Nike. Moreover, he established his own successful “CR7”
                brand of products that included shoes, underwear, and fragrances. Ronaldo’s immense marketability was at
                the centre of a legal issue that arose in June 2017. That month prosecutors filed a lawsuit that accused
                Ronaldo of defrauding the Spanish government of €14.7 million ($16.5 million) by hiding his image-rights
                income in Spain from 2011 to 2014. He was accused of having underestimated the income he earned from the
                sale and licensing of his image rights and the accompanying tax obligations, but Ronaldo denied all
                allegations. However, in June 2018 he accepted a suspended two-year prison sentence and agreed to pay
                €18.8 million ($21.8 million) to the Spanish government to settle the case.</p>
            <h2>Player Profile</h2>
            <h5>Style of Play</h5>
            <P>A versatile attacker, Ronaldo is capable of playing on either wing as well as through the centre of the
                pitch,[395] and, while ostensibly right-footed, is very strong with both feet.[396] He ranks among the
                world's fastest footballers, both with and without the ball.[397] Tactically, Ronaldo has undergone
                several evolutions throughout his career. While at Sporting and during his first season at Manchester
                United, he was typically deployed as a traditional winger on the right side of midfield, where he
                regularly looked to deliver crosses into the penalty area. In this position, he was able to use his pace
                and acceleration, agility and technical skills to take on opponents in one-on-one situations. Ronaldo
                became noted for his dribbling and flair, often displaying an array of tricks and feints,[397][398] such
                as the step overs and so-called 'chops' that became his trademark;[399] he has also been known to use
                the flip–flap.[400]</P>
            <P>As Ronaldo matured, he underwent a major physical transformation, developing a muscular body type that
                allowed him to retain possession of the ball under pressure, and strong legs that enabled an outstanding
                jumping ability.[402] His strength and jumping ability, combined with his elevation, heading accuracy
                and height of 1.87 m (6 ft 1+1⁄2 in), give him an edge in winning aerial duels. These attributes allow
                him to function as a target-man and make him an aerial goal threat in the penalty area; consequently,
                many of his goals have been headers.[403][404][405] Allied with his increased stamina and work-rate, his
                goalscoring ability improved drastically on the left wing where he was given the positional freedom to
                move into the centre to finish attacks. He has also increasingly played a creative role for his team,
                often dropping deep to pick up the ball, participate in the build-up of plays and create chances for his
                teammates, courtesy of his vision and passing ability.[397][403]

                In his final seasons at United, Ronaldo played an even more attacking and central role, functioning both
                as a striker and as a supporting forward, or even as an attacking midfielder on occasion.[403] He
                developed into a prolific goalscorer, capable of finishing well both inside the penalty area and from
                distance with an accurate and powerful shot, courtesy of his striking ability.[403][406] An accurate
                penalty kick taker,[407] he also became a set piece specialist, renowned for his powerful, bending free
                kicks.[408] When taking free kicks, Ronaldo is known for using the knuckleball technique, which was
                developed by Juninho Pernambucano.[409] He also adopts a trademark stance before striking the ball,
                which involves him standing with his legs far apart.[410] Regarding Ronaldo's unique style of taking
                free kicks, former Manchester United assistant manager Mike Phelan commented: "People used to put the
                ball down, walk away, run up and hit it. He brought in a more dynamic showmanship. He places the ball
                down, the concentration level is high, he takes his certain amount of steps back so that his standing
                foot is in the perfect place to hit the ball in the sweet spot. He is the ultimate showman. He has that
                slight arrogance. When he pulls those shorts up and shows his thighs, he is saying 'All eyes on me' and
                this is going in. He understands the marketing side of it. The way he struts up and places it; the world
                is watching him."[411]</P>
